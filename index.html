    <h4>Programming 💻 </h4>
    I'm just starting out programming, but I already have some skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm always eager to continue learning and growing.

  <h4>Fitness 🏋🏻‍♀️ </h4>
  I love living a healthy lifestyle, so I always try to make time to exercise for at least a couple of hours a day. Additionally, I focus on eating real foods with sufficient nutrients to maintain optimal performance at work and in personal relationships.

  <h4>Read 📚 </h4>
  I'm an avid reader, although it took me some effort to develop that habit during my childhood and adolescence. Nowadays, I always try to read at least 10 pages a day on a topic that interests me.

  <h4>Coffee ☕️ </h4>
  I must say that when it comes to coffee, I'm quite a connoisseur. When working remotely, I enjoy going to cafes to experience a pleasant and comfy atmosphere.
